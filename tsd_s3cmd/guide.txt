Usage: tsd-s3cmd [OPTIONS]

Using the s3 API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a .s3cfg in your HOME directory.

Your TSD project's access and secret key can be found in:
/tsd/pXX/data/durable/s3-api-access-keys. The config file
should look like this:

    host_base = api.tsd.usit.no
    host_bucket = api.tsd.usit.no
    # include the following bucket_location line even though it is not used
    bucket_location = us-east-1
    use_https = True
    access_key = ACCESS_KEY
    secret_key = SECRET_KEY
    signature_v2 = False

2. Now register your tsd-s3cmd with your TSD project:

    tsd-s3cmd --register
    # choose 'prod'

This will prompt you for your TSD credentials. To register for p11, for example,
enter your p11 credentials. Similar for any other projects. You have to
register for each project you have access to. The above command stores an API
key in a config file in your HOME directory. API keys are projects specific,
and allow you to authenticate. By themselves they do not give access to TSD.

3. Create a bucket (e.g. named mybucket):

    tsd-s3cmd mb s3://mybucket

4. Upload data:

To upload a single file

    tsd-s3cmd put file s3://mybucket

If the upload fails for some reason, tsd-s3cmd will print an id, which you can use
to resume the upload as follows:

    tsd-s3cmd --upload-id id put file s3://mybucket

You can also specify explicit chunk sizes

    tsd-s3cmd --multipart-chunk-size-mb=200 put data s3://mybucket

You can also synchronise directories this is useful if your directory
changes in incremental ways and you only want to transfer the diff to TSD

    tsd-s3cmd --multipart-chunk-size-mb=200 sync dir s3://mybucket

Restart the sync if it fails

    tsd-s3cmd --multipart-chunk-size-mb=200 --upload-id id sync dir s3://mybucket

5. Download data

Data can only be exported from the 'export-bucket'. This is a folder in TSD,
located at /tsd/pXX/data/durable/s3-api/export-bucket. This folder is only
accessible by member of the pXX-export-group.

Then outside TSD:

    tsd-s3cmd ls s3://export-bucket
    tsd-s3cmd get s3://export-bucket/myfile

6. To interact with the test API:

    tsd-s3cmd --usetest [OPTIONS]

7. If you have a long-lasting upload which requires batch programming
You can request an import token, save it, and use s3cmd directly. For
guidance on how to do this, do e.g.:

    tsd-s3cmd --print-token-for put
